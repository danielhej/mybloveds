# Mybloveds 🎉

First off, big thanks to [Burak Orkmez](https://github.com/burakorkmez) for his awesome [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/tWHXaSC2T_s) that inspired this project! 🙌

## About This Project 📚

**Mybloveds** is a simple, single-page application designed for learning purposes and building a basic resume project. It functions like a contact manager where you can add, update, and delete contacts (with attributes like name, role, description, and gender), and everything is saved to a database. The cool part? You don’t have to refresh the page—everything updates live! 🚀

## Features ✨

- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: No page reloads! Everything happens dynamically on one page. 🖥️
- **Live Updates**: Create, delete, or update contact info and see changes immediately. 🔄
- **Simple & Clean UI**: Focused on functionality and user-friendly interactions. 🎨

## Live Version 🌐

You can check out the live version of **Mybloveds** at [mybloveds.onrender.com](https://mybloveds.onrender.com). 

### Features of the Live Version:

- **Immediate Access**: No need to set up anything on your local machine—just visit the link to use the app! 🔗
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Experience all the features, such as adding, updating, and deleting contacts, all in real time without page reloads! 🚀
- **User-Friendly**: Enjoy a clean and simple interface directly in your browser.
