# Mybloveds 🎉

First off, big thanks to [Burak Orkmez](https://github.com/burakorkmez) for his awesome [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/tWHXaSC2T_s) that inspired this project! 🙌

## About This Project 📚

**Mybloveds** is a simple, single-page application designed for learning purposes and building a basic resume project. It functions like a contact manager where you can add, update, and delete contacts (with attributes like name, role, description, and gender), and everything is saved to a database. The cool part? You don’t have to refresh the page—everything updates live! 🚀

## Features ✨

- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: No page reloads! Everything happens dynamically on one page. 🖥️
- **Live Updates**: Create, delete, or update contact info and see changes immediately. 🔄
- **Simple & Clean UI**: Focused on functionality and user-friendly interactions. 🎨
